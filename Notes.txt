Checkers - CLI based Checkers Game.
basic rules:
    1. 2 players
        a. Red
        b. Black
    2. Black player moves first
    3. One board per game
    4. 12 pieces for each player
    5. Players place their pieces on the 12 dark squares in the first three rows closest to player.
    6. Each of these rows should have a total of 4 pieces.
    7. The back row (row closest to the player) is the KING ROW.
    8. Pieces may only move 1 diagonal place forward towards their opponet.
    9. Pieces must stay on the dark squares.
    10. Capturing pieces is achieved by jumping over it.
    11. The space on the other side of the piece you intend to capture must be empty.
    12. You can chain together jumps as long as the above criteria is met.
    13. If your piece makes it to the very back row you make re-take one capture piece and crown the piece you made it
    to the other side of the board with. This is piece is no a King piece.
    14. King pieces may still only move one space at a time during non-capturing moves. However, when capturing pieces
    the king can move diagonally forward or backwards.
    15. There is no limit to the amount of king pieces a player may have.

Summary: In order to play checkers we need at a minimum 4 physical things:
    1. A red player.
    2. A black player
    3. Game pieces.
    4. A game board.

We would at least need the following classes to accomplish this.
    1. Player
    2. GamePieces
    3. GameBoard.

If we think about this more deeply, we can actually seperate these out further. The goal should be to abstract as much
as reasonably possible.

We need to create at least the above so we can have a game of checkers.
=======================================================================================================================
Board:

    What is a board? It's a square piece of material (cardboard, wood, metal, anything we can make a square from). The
    board is a grid of 8 rows, and 8 columns. The intersection of a column and row create a "spot" or "square". White
    or "light" square are not used. Dark squares can contain pieces.

    Thinking like this we would have 2 classes related to the board.

    A Board class, and a Square class. The board would use Squares to construct a game surface for us to plan on.

    Our board needs the following basic features.

        1. We need to be able to "create" a board. Even if it's empty.

        2. We need to be able to set the board up to the default starting positon for all pieces.

        3. At any time we need to be able to print the board out and display it's current state: where all the pieces are.

    To accomplish this our Board class would rely on a Square class. This Square class would be used to build out our
    rows and columns. It would also be used to display and "hold" pieces. At anytime I should be able to call something
    like:
        Square.getPiece();

    This is an over simplificaiton, but it's the heart of what we need. That should return to us whether a regular
    piece, king piece or no piece is on it. We should also be able to determine what "player" controls that piece (red
    or black).

====================Notes on board continued===========================================================================
Board:

What does my board need to provide? The board needs to be printed in some default state, say the initial setup of a
checkers game. The board needs to be able to be printed in it's current state; where pieces are right now. The board
should also provide a method to add a piece to the board somewhere, and remove the piece from the board. At a high level
this is what our board class should provide.

Diving a little deeper we need to consider the HOW of providing this to other developers. Let's discuss the details

1. We need to be able to create a board from our class. This can be accomplished with a general constructor.
2. We need to be able to print the board at any time for our user. Let's first print a blank board.

So at a bare minimum I want to accomplish printing an empty board; even if it's literally just empty and all NULL.

If I start thinking about that process something comes to mind, a board is made up of squares that intersect by row &
column (x,y). I'll create a class called Square or position; something along those lines.

This class would at a minimum have some coordinates, and a data type of a piece. We'll also need a method to set a piece
on that square. So while overall we're broadly touching "the board" the board is itself made up of squares. So, with that
in mind what I really want to do is create a board object, and then print out all the squares and whatever pieces might
exist on them.

Let's assume I'm just developing the board, not pieces. How can I go about doing this without a Piece class? Let's setup
a generic Piece class that literally just contains a string, a name for the piece. We can even, at this point just print
strings on the board. We can still get the same performance; though we'd need to come back to this and modify our methods
later once we have our piece class.

What should my board class have:

Board:

1. Data:
    1a. Squares (we'll create several squares for our board)
    2a. game pieces

2. Methods:
    2a. A general constructor
    2b. A setBoard method to setup our board.
    2c. A showBoard method to display the board.
    2d. A setPiece to set a piece on a square
    2e. A removePiece to remove a piece from the square.


Generally speaking, this is how I'd think about the board. This may change as we dive in and I start to think about
other aspects (pieces, moves, etc).

At the end of the day, the board shouldn't care if the pieces move is valid (it'd be great if it did); it just needs to
provide some method of adding a piece to our board.

Square:

1. Data:
    1a. xCord
    1b. yCord
    1b. Piece

2. Methods:
    2a. setPiece
    2b. setPiece
    2c. A general constructor

=======================================================================================================================
Pieces

What do we need to do with pieces? Pieces in Checkers fall into two categories; a regular checkers piece, and a king
checkers piece. A regular checkers piece is capable of moving 1 row up, and one row right or left; effectively an angle.
These pieces are also grouped into two colors, red and white (or any colors really).

The square a piece is moving to must be free, meaning another piece cannot be in it's way. However, a piece may "jump"
over another piece. If we have a setup (let X represent player 1, Y represent player 2, and 0 represents an empty space:

0X0X0
00Y00
X0000

The first X on line 138 represent a piece. We an "jump" the Y piece on line 139. It would end up looking like this once
the jump is completed

000X0
00000
X00X0

The Y piece was taken, and the X move to the square behind and to the right of the Y piece.

This should, in an ideal setup occur automatically with no interaction from the user. Meaning, if a use moves to a
new square, and in the course of it's movement jumps an enemy piece, it should be handled automatically.

Our Piece class should be responsible for creating our general game pieces, and providing a method to move pieces. We
will also need to handle the logic of moving a piece; which should handle the logic (confirming if a move is valid).

Let's discsuss the move some more and get an idea of what we need to do.

The board will provide us a method to place a piece on a square, and remove a piece from a square. Our movement will use
this method to move (without taking a piece) and move when we jump a piece.

Move validation should first validate that the move of a piece is valid; meaning, that piece can legally move to the
square being specified.

The move validation will also need to be aware of the piece type. If it's a regular piece it's movement is limited 1
row towards the enemoy, and 1 column left or right.

If the piece is a KING type the movement changes every so slightly for normal movement. It can move forward and backward
, it's jump is dramatically different. A regular piece can make double or triple jumps but only in a forward direction.

The king, on the other hand, is capable of jumping forward, then backward. The move validation will need to account for
this.

If a piece jumps any enemy pieces during this movement the validation should check this as well. For any square that is
"crossed" with an enemy piece on it, the movement should "kill" and remove those pieces.

When it comes to moving a simple solution with ABS and subtracting X and Y can work. The problem is what happens if
the player wants to jump a piece?

The complexity comes in to play because we want to automatically handle when the user jumps a piece; simply when they
select the position to move to.

So how do we handle simple jumps?

Option 1:
    Explain that the user can "attack" a piece by moving to it's square. Then we can test if the piece after that one is
    empty of has a piece on it.

Option 2:
    Let the user specify the coordinates to "jump" to, and check if a piece was jumped.

Lets dive more into the details of the pieces.

First, we need to have a class for our pieces; we can extend (or use an interface) to regular pieces and king pieces.
